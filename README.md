# KPT Differ

WIP.

## Preparation

- Admin creates `Binder`s. "Keep", "Problem" and "Try".
- Admin creates `History`. `History` generates `Reports` on each `Binders` for every users.

## Usage

- At each end of KPT span, Admin creates new `History`.
- New `History` generates new `Reports`.
- System freezes old `History` and old `Report`s on `History` creation.
- Frozen `Report`s are not editable.
- A new `Report` indicates diff from oneself old `Report`.
